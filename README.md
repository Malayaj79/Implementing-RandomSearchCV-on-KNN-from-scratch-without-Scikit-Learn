# Implementing-RandomSearchCV-on-KNN-from-scratch-without-Scikit-Learn
Random Search sets up a grid of hyperparameter values and selects random combinations to train the model and score. This allows us to explicitly control the number of parameter combinations that are attempted. The number of search iterations is set based on time or resources. Scikit Learn offers the RandomizedSearchCV function for this process.
In this project, I've implemented a custom RandomSearchCV from scratch using the principles and the concepts that goes behind the curtain in the implementation of this technique.
